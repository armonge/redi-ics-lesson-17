// This is a single line comment
const constant = "This is a string constant";
let number = 10 // this is number variable




























// Same as in python, we can have dicts, lists and other objects
let myList = [1, 2, 3]; // BTW! That was camelcase! Did you notice that? What do you think that is?
let dict = {"Key": "Value"};


























// Same as in python, they have methods
constant.toLowerCase()
number.toString();
myList.push(4);






















// and you can access it's elements with the key
const areTheyEqual = dict['Key'] === dict.Key; // Javascript allows this new syntax to access a key properties though
const theResult = { areTheyEqual }; // and lots of other syntax sugar
